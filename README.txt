I implemented a Multithread server, so I think I did the advanced server for part 2

-did not implement bonus

-NOTE: WebServer MUST be in the same directory as its primary "index.html" file in order to run properly. It is only able to access local and subdirectory files, not superdirectory ones.
 Consequently, WebServer MUST be compiled using the Makefile, and run using "java WebServer <port>"
